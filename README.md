## Chapter 1: Stacks;

-Chapter 1: Stacks: The stack data structure is similar in concept to a physical 
stack of objects. When you add an item to a stack, you place it on top of the stack. 
When you remove an item from a stack, you always remove the top-most item. 
Stacks are useful and also exceedingly simple. The main goal of building a stack is 
to enforce how you access your data.

## Chapter 2: Linked lists;

-Chapter 2: Linked Lists: A linked list is a collection of values arranged in a linear, 
unidirectional sequence. It has some theoretical advantages over contiguous 
storage options such as Dartâ€™s List, including constant time insertion and 
removal from the front of the list.

## Chapter 3: Queues;

-Chapter 3: Queues: Lines are everywhere, whether you are lining up to buy 
tickets to your favorite movie or waiting for a printer to print out your documents. 
These real-life scenarios mimic the queue data structure. Queues use first-in-firstout ordering, meaning the first enqueued element will be the first to get dequeued. 
Queues are handy when you need to maintain the order of your elements to 
process later.
