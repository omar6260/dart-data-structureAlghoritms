## Chapter 3: Stacks

Stacks are everywhere. Here are some common examples of things you would stack:

- pancakes
- books
- paper
- cash
The stack data structure is identical in concept to a physical stack of objects. When
you add an item to a stack, you place it on top of the stack. When you remove an
item from a stack, you always remove the top-most item

## Chapter 4: Linked lists

Linked Lists: A linked list is a collection of values arranged in a linear,
unidirectional sequence. It has some theoretical advantages over contiguous
storage options such as Dart’s List, including constant time insertion and
removal from the front of the list.

## Chapter 5: Queues

Queues: Lines are everywhere, whether you are lining up to buy
tickets to your favorite movie or waiting for a printer to print out your documents.
These real-life scenarios mimic the queue data structure. Queues use first-in-firstout ordering, meaning the first enqueued element will be the first to get dequeued.
Queues are handy when you need to maintain the order of your elements to
process later.

## Chapter 6: Tree

The tree is a data structure of profound importance. It’s used to tackle many
recurring challenges in software development, such as:

- Representing hierarchical relationships.
- Managing sorted data.
- Facilitating fast lookup operations.

## Chapter 7: Binar_Tree

In the previous chapter, you looked at a basic tree where each node can have many
children. A binary tree is a tree where each node has at most two children, often
referred to as the left and right children.
Binary trees serve as the basis for many tree structures and algorithms. In this
chapter, you’ll build a binary tree and learn about the three most important tree
traversal algorithms.
